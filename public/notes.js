/*
why use interfaces? why separate interface from implementation?
1. simplifies things. To figure out what something does, 
dont have to look at implementation, JUST at interface
2. contract - dont NEED to know implmentation to still use it.
3. contract is TRUST - only works if the other part follows through

4. can upgrade implementation at any time
can be many kinds of implemntations - can cah

5. (most confusing) we can swap different implementations
BASED ON what class you're using (ie. inheritance)
